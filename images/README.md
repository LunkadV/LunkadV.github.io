# Image Placeholders

This folder is for your portfolio images. You should add the following images:

1. `profile.jpg` - Your professional profile picture (recommended size: 600x600px)
2. `project1.jpg` - Screenshot or image representing your Algorithmic Poker Game project
3. `project2.jpg` - Screenshot or image representing your DCF Calculator project
4. `project3.jpg` - Screenshot or image representing your Prosthetic Hand project
5. `favicon.png` - A small icon for your browser tab (recommended size: 32x32px)

Until you add these images, the site will show broken image links. You can create temporary placeholder images using services like:
- https://placeholder.com/
- https://placehold.co/

Or use free stock photos from sites like Unsplash or Pexels.
